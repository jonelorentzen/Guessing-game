# Project - Guessing Game
The project handin will will require a
significant amount of work in groups. We expect students to form groups and work together
on this lab handin. For this lab handin the passing level will also be > 80
points per lab. We will evaluate each handin separately and give the group a
joint grade per lab. **The final lab grade will be determined by the oral
examination/demo in the lab. The oral exam will be conducted group/individually.**

## Plagiarism Warning

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student’s
text or source code, will result in the grade F, and may be reported
to the university for administrative processing. Committing acts that
violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are
cause for suspension or dismissal from UiS.

*Don’t cheat. It’s not worth it!*
